# PwC Internship - Power BI in Data Analytics

## Tools Used

  **Business Intelligence Tools:** Excel, Power BI
  
## Project Steps
 
### Data Import & Data Cleaning
 
Given data was in excel file with impurities. Soit is better to do all possible cleaning in excel using Power Query. The dataset given some time has impurities such as missing values or incorrect data types.

### Data Importing in Power Bi

In Power BI, we have options to connect to our dataset via various options such as SQL Server, MYSQL, excel or CSV files. We have our clean data in CSV file. We will import it in Power BI with import data option and start working with it.

### Data Transformation in Power BI

Once the data is imported in Power BI, we do ‘transform data’ i.e. using Power Query editor to perform certain operation on to the data. Ensuring correct data types, creating custom/conditional columns are some fundamental task performed in Power Query.

### Creating a report in Power BI

A report is created in Power BI with various charts depicting Sales insights for particular year, month and so on. We created Slicers, Data Cards, Sales Trend for Year and Month, Table for top ordered item, top performing sales representatives and relationship between different variables that directly or indirectly impact sales and all sorts of visuals needed for respective analysis.

### Deployement in Power BI

In Power BI, You can directly publish the report online to your workstation. If you do not have the work email-id then you can save the file in ‘.pbix’ version. This helps another viewer see your work and understand the story or insights you’re communicating.
